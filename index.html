		<h3>Getting There</h3>
		<p>
			Since the venue is pretty far out from the city center and we don't want our guests to have to drive back on the desert highways after dark, we've chartered a bus to get you there and back from the city center. We'll arrange for the bus to pick up guests at two locations on- and off-strip so that no matter where you stay, you'll be close to a pickup point.
		</p>

		<h3>The ceremony</h3>
		<p>
			The ceremony will be performed at 6:00pm PDT. It will last approximately 30 minutes, then be followed by a cocktail hour and reception until 11:00pm PDT. Our wedding colors are
						<span style="background:thistle;color:black">dusty lavender, </span>
						<span style="background:navy;color:white">navy, </span> and 
						<span style="background:lightgreen;color:black">Sage</span>
			Cocktail attire is requested.
		</p>
		<h3>The reception</h3>
		<p>
			The reception will include dinner and drinks, a DJ and dancing. Dinner will be served at approximately 7:30pm PDT.

			Las Vegas doesn't typically do discounted social room blocks, unfortunately, so we don't have a single central hotel. We can, however, recommend a few options for different experiences and price points.
		</p>
		<p>
			Keep in mind that with all Las Vegas hotels, you'll be paying a resort fee of $32-$40 per room per night. There's not really a way around this and travel websites don't really do a good job of showing it to you. 
		</p>
		<p>
			All that said, we'd recommend Palace Station or Treasure Island as budget options that are conveniently located, or your casino of choice for a higher-end experience. The Venetian | Palazzo or Caesar's Palace are famous, tried-and-true luxury options. 
		</p>
		<p>
			You might also wish to rent or share a whole house through AirBnB or other short term rental; please let us know if this is the case and we can put you in touch with others who might wish to split a rental.
